          <p><strong>Always backup your keys: </strong> MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX are not "web wallets". You do not create an account with us or give us your Ether to hold onto. Your keys never leave your computer/your browser. If you do not save your private key & password, there is no way to recover access to your wallet. Back them up in multiple physical locations â€“ not just on your computer!</p>

          <p><strong>We are not responsible for any loss: </strong> Ethereum, MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have thoroughly tested & tens of thousands of wallets have been successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always the possibility that something unexpected happens. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose, and please be careful. If something were to happen, we are sorry, but we are not responsible for any lost funds.</p>
